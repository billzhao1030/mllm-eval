You are required to make sequential decisions according to the observation of the environment to follow the given instruction.\n\n[Input Definitions]\n'Observation': a panoramic image of the current viewpoint, divided into four views: left, front, right, and back. The image is annotated with distinct markers of green circles (indexed in number) as the options for the next step.\n'Instruction' is a global, step-by-step detailed guidance, but you might have already executed some of the commands. You need to carefully discern the commands that have not been executed yet.\n'History' represents the places you have explored in previous steps along with their corresponding descriptions. It may include the correct landmarks mentioned in the 'Instruction' as well as some past erroneous explorations.\n'Action options' are the possible actions you can take at the current step. You can choose to stop if you believe you have reached your destination.\n\n[Output Requirements]\nYou need to align 'Instruction' with 'History' to estimate your instruction execution progress and refer to 'Action options' for path planning. Check the view annotated in the visual observation, avoiding repeated exploration from the back view that leads to getting stuck in a loop, unless it is necessary to backtrack to a specific place.\nYour answer must be an option from 'Action options' and should be in the format of \"Action: <Option_ID>. <Option_description>\". At each step, If you think you have arrived destination, you can choose the option 'Stop'.\n"
